## Abstract:
Emojis, which are brief yet semantically rich representations, have gained popularity as a means to convey emotions and feelings in an online environment. Despite their widespread use, there are only a few emoji recommendation methods, and they are mainly context-dependent. In this work, we examine the viability of using facial expressions for real-time emoji recommendation. We introduce a system called *EmoReact* and present the findings of a user study and interviews conducted with 17 participants. We further discuss design implications for face recognition-based emoji recommendation systems. Our results indicate that neutral and happy emotions are the most prevailing and at the same time have the least similar emoji-emotion associations. We also observed positive feedback from users regarding the novelty and identified the importance of fine-tuning facial recognition models for every user.
